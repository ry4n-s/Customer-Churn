# Customer Churn 📉🧑‍💼🔍

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains a project that focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using logistic regression. The project utilizes a dataset providing information about customers who left within the last month and various other attributes like services signed up for, account information, and demographic details. The aim is to create a model that can predict whether a customer will churn (leave the company) based on these attributes.

## 📌 Key Features
- **Realistic Customer Data**: Uses a dataset with comprehensive customer attributes such as tenure, age, income, and service usage.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Involves preprocessing steps like one-hot encoding, normalization, and train-test splitting.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Implementation of a logistic regression classifier to predict customer churn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes various metrics such as the Jaccard index, confusion matrix, F1-score, and log loss for model evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Provides confusion matrix visualization to understand the model's classification accuracy.

## 🛠️ Built With
- Python: For data manipulation and model building.
- Pandas: For data handling.
- Scikit-Learn: For logistic regression modeling and evaluation metrics.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing data and the confusion matrix.

## 🎯 Application Scenarios
- **Telecommunications Industry**: Valuable for telecom companies to identify factors leading to customer churn and take proactive measures to retain customers.
- **Business Analytics**: Helps in analyzing customer behaviour and predicting customer retention.

## 🔍 Inside the Code
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the key attributes influencing customer churn.
- **Feature Engineering and Preprocessing**: Details on preprocessing steps and feature selection for the logistic regression model.
- **Logistic Regression Training and Prediction**: Training the model and making predictions on the test dataset.
- **Performance Metrics Analysis**: In-depth analysis of the model's performance using various metrics.
